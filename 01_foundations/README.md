# Foundations

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks | **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

This section covers the fundamental building blocks of DSA. Master these before moving forward.

## Learning Order

1. **Big O Notation** (2-3 days)
   - Understanding time and space complexity
   - Essential for analyzing any algorithm

2. **Arrays** (3-4 days)
   - Most fundamental data structure
   - Learn common manipulation patterns

3. **Strings** (3-4 days)
   - Similar to arrays but with specific techniques
   - Heavy in interviews

4. **Hash Tables** (3-4 days)
   - Critical for optimization
   - Enables O(1) lookups

## Key Techniques

After learning the data structures, master these patterns:

- **Two Pointers**: Efficient array/string traversal
- **Sliding Window**: Subarray/substring problems
- **Frequency Counting**: Using hash maps to count occurrences

## Topics

### [01 - Big O Notation](./01_big_o_notation/)
Learn to analyze algorithm efficiency and compare solutions.

**Key Concepts**:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Best, average, worst case
- Common complexity classes

### [02 - Arrays](./02_arrays/)
Master array manipulation and common patterns.

**Key Concepts**:
- Indexing and traversal
- Two pointer technique
- In-place modifications
- Sorting and searching

### [03 - Strings](./03_strings/)
String manipulation and pattern matching.

**Key Concepts**:
- String traversal
- Palindromes
- Substrings
- String building techniques

### [04 - Hash Tables](./04_hash_tables/)
Fast lookups and frequency counting.

**Key Concepts**:
- Hash maps and sets
- Collision handling
- Time complexity analysis
- Common use cases

## Practice Goals

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- [ ] Analyze time and space complexity of any algorithm
- [ ] Use two pointers to solve array problems efficiently
- [ ] Implement sliding window for substring problems
- [ ] Use hash maps to optimize solutions from O(n²) to O(n)
- [ ] Recognize when to use each data structure

## Common Interview Problems

- Two Sum, Three Sum
- Valid Anagram
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Contains Duplicate
- Product of Array Except Self
- Group Anagrams

## Next Steps

After completing Foundations, move to [Core Data Structures](../02_core_data_structures/) to learn Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Heaps.
